## Features

    1) Extracts individual trade records from structured trade history data.
    2) Computes key financial metrics:
        - Return on Investment (ROI)
        - Total Profit & Loss (PnL)
        - Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return)
        - Maximum Drawdown (MDD) (measuring portfolio risk)
        - Win Rate & Trade Statistics
    3) Implements a ranking algorithm to identify top-performing accounts.
    4) Outputs detailed performance reports in CSV format.

## Technologies Used

    1) Python (for data analysis)
    2) Pandas & NumPy (for financial calculations)
